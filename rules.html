			<h1>Server Rules</h1><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Griefing, stealing, X-ray, and unconsensual PVP is not allowed</li>
				<li>Racism/sexism/homophobia/transphobia/xenophobia ect. will not be tolerated in any form</li>
				<li>Put effort into your builds! It's okay if building isn't your strong suit. It's not mine either. All that I ask is for you to put some effort. The goal of the server is to make the world look pretty!</li>
				<li>Don't destroy the landscape. This ties into the previous rule. Don't just blow up a mountain for fun, try to incorporate the existing landscape into your builds if you can. If you plan to terraform an area, that's okay. Don't leave random junk blocks placed around the world.</li>
